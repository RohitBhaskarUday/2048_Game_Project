# 2048_Game_Project

This is based on a very popular game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to 
slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 

Here is a Python version that uses TKinter!

Run the User Interface file.
